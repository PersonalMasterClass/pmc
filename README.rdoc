Personal Masterclass is a two-sided marketplace. On one side are the country-based schools and their VCE teachers who book and pay for VCE revision sessions; on the other side of the marketplace are freelance presenters who are typically highly credentialed VCE teachers in Melbourne.

===User
There are three classes of User: 
*Customer - a school (or department of a school) that books presenters for VCE revision sessions. 
*Presenter - a VCE teacher who can be booked for revision sessions. 
*Administrator - User for managing the system.

===PresenterProfile
The PresenterProfile model represents each presenters profile. Due to the requirement for administrators to approve profiles, this model contains a "live" profile and "editing" profile, once the profile has been approved, the editing profile overwrites the live to be displayed to system users.

===SchoolInfo
Information about each school is obtained from http://data.gov.au/storage/f/2013-05-12T190731/tmpo4Hjs2all-schools-list.csv a dataset of information about ever school in Victoria. The data is populated by running the `import:school_info` rake task. Should the location of this dataset change in the future, the URL can be updated using the `dat` variable in import.rake .

Both the Customer (school) and Presenter model use the SchoolInfo model to provide static contact information.

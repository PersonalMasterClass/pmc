# Scripts
The scripts in this directory are used for deploying the Personal Masterclass application.

## provision.sh
This file is designed to install the dependencies for the Personal Masterclass application on a fresh self-contained (atomic) installation of CentOS 7.  
You may have to tweak this in order to get it to work on other operating systems.

To test this script, run it in a fresh CentOS 7 VM.
